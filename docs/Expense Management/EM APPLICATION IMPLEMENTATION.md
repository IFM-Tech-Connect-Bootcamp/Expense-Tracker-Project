# Expense Management Application Layer Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a complete, clean, DRY, and strictly typed application layer for the Expense Management bounded context. The implementation follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and Clean Architecture patterns, orchestrating business use cases and coordinating between the domain layer and infrastructure concerns.  Please use this as your guide to understand the application layer. Furthermore, each file contains explicit documentation to help you understand what is going on. All the best!

## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure

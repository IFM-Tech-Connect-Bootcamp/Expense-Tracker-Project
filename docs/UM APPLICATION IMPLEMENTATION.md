# User Management Application Layer Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a complete, clean, DRY, and strictly typed application layer for the User Management bounded context. The implementation follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and Clean Architecture patterns, orchestrating business use cases and coordinating between the domain layer and infrastructure concerns. **This implementation has been fully converted from async to sync architecture for improved team maintainability and simplified development patterns.** Please use this as your guide to understand the application layer. Furthermore, each file contains explicit documentation to help you understand what is going on. All the best!

## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure

The application layer is organized as follows:
